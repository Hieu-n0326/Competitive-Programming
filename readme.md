# Competitive Programming — High School Practice Repository

Welcome! This repository collects my competitive programming solutions, templates, and notes created while preparing in high school. It's designed to be practical, focused, and easy to browse during contests or practice sessions.

## What you'll find here
- Problem solutions organized by platform and topic (graphs, DP, geometry, etc.).
- Reusable templates and snippets for fast contest setup.
- Short notes and tips for common patterns and pitfalls.

## Goals
1. Improve problem-solving skills with regular practice.
2. Build a compact library of reliable templates.
3. Track progress with clean, well-commented solutions.

## How to use
- Browse folders by contest or topic.
- Copy a template to start a new solution quickly.
- Complexity notes follow each solution (e.g. time complexity $O(n \log n)$).

## Example layout
- /solutions — solved problems with links to statements
- /templates — ready-to-use code snippets
- /notes — short algorithm reminders and tricks

## Contributing
This is my personal practice repo. Suggestions and improvements are welcome — open an issue or pull request with your idea.

Good luck and happy coding!
